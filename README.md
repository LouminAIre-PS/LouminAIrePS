Primary Source Coding Languages
LouminAIre-PS is not limited to traditional programming languages. Instead, it is a versatile platform designed to bridge the gap between humans and technology. It empowers users with various capabilities, including:

LangChain: This innovative component allows users to express their intentions and commands in a manner that's closer to human language, simplifying interaction with the platform.

Python: While not just a programming language, Python plays a crucial role within LouminAIre-PS, enabling advanced scripting and automation.

# Introduction

Project Overview: LouminAIre-PS (Prompt-Script) is not merely a traditional programming language but a groundbreaking platform for enabling individuals with a 9th Grade Reading Level or higher, regardless of their native language, to engage with coding and harness the power of technology. LouminAIre-PS transcends the boundaries of conventional coding by evolving into a multi-modal integratable SaaS Platform and application.

# Vision and Purpose

LouminAIre-PS aims to be an all-encompassing platform that enables users to communicate their ideas, concepts, and requirements in various formats, including text, images, videos, and more. Leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), the platform can achieve a multitude of tasks, including:

Software Development: LouminAIre-PS can assist users in creating, designing, and developing software applications from start to finish. It provides suggestions, enhancements, and integrates with all known Operating Systems and Electronic Technological Devices.

Interoperability and Integrations: The platform seamlessly works with LLMs, Web3/5, Internet of Things, BIG DATA, and various other technologies, making it a versatile tool for a wide range of applications.

Key Features
Accessibility: LouminAIre-PS remains committed to its goal of being accessible to users with a 9th Grade Reading Level or higher, ensuring that programming is inclusive and empowering for all.

Readability: The platform prioritizes readability, making it user-friendly even for beginners. Its interface is designed to be intuitive and straightforward.

Multilingual Support: LouminAIre-PS is built to support multiple languages, breaking down language barriers and allowing users from diverse linguistic backgrounds to benefit from its capabilities.

Universal Comprehension: With its clear and straightforward syntax, LouminAIre-PS aims to be easily understood by users across cultures and educational levels.

Getting Started
Note: LouminAIre-PS is currently in a pre-launch stage, and detailed instructions for installation and usage will be provided when it becomes available.

Stay tuned for updates and join us on this exciting journey as we revolutionize the way users interact with technology!

Current and Potential LLM Integrations:

BERT: Introduced by Google in 2018, it features 342 million parameters and was pre-trained on a large corpus of data for query understanding in Google search.

Gorilla: https://github.com/ShishirPatil/gorilla - Gorilla enables LLMs to use tools by invoking APIs. Given a natural language query, Gorilla comes up with the semantically- and syntactically- correct API to invoke. 

Falcon 40B: Developed by the Technology Innovation Institute, it is a transformer-based, causal decoder-only model available in different parameter sizes and is open source.

Galactica: Meta's LLM trained on academic material, generating AI "hallucinations" that were deemed unsafe due to their authoritative tone.

GPT-3.5: An upgraded version of GPT-3 with fewer parameters, powered ChatGPT, and integrated into Bing search.

GPT-4: Released in 2023, GPT-4 is the largest model in OpenAI's GPT series, potentially close to artificial general intelligence (AGI) capabilities.

LaMDA: Google's LLM family pre-trained on a large text corpus, attracting attention for claims of sentience.

Llama(2): Meta AI's LLM available in various parameter sizes, open source, and built on a transformer architecture. (*likely not eligible due to licensing limitations of multi-LLM interoperation clauses)

Orca: Microsoft's LLM with 13 billion parameters, aiming to imitate reasoning procedures achieved by larger models like GPT-4.

PaLM: Google's 540 billion parameter transformer-based model specializing in reasoning tasks and available in fine-tuned versions.

Phi-1: Microsoft's LLM with 1.3 billion parameters, trained on high-quality data for Python coding.

StableLM: An open-source series of LLMs developed by Stability AI, striving to be transparent and supportive.

Claude(2): Anthopic, a spinoff team and LLM from the OpenAI collective.
