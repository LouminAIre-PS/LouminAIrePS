README - INTRODUCTION

Project Overview:
LouminAIre-PS(Prompt-Script) is an open-source programming language, interoperating with AI, and all known languages, developed with the goal of enabling individuals with a 9th Grade Reading Level, or beyond, regardless of their language, to engage with coding and harness the power of technology. This language aims to bridge the gap between humans and technology by prioritizing simplicity, clarity, and universal comprehension.

Key Features
Accessibility: LouminAIre-PS is designed to be accessible to users with a 9th Grade Reading Level, making programming more inclusive and empowering.
Readability: The language focuses on readability, making it easier for users to understand and write code, even for beginners.
Multilingual Support: LouminAIre-PS is built to support multiple languages, ensuring that users from diverse linguistic backgrounds can benefit from the language.
Universal Comprehension: With a clear and straightforward syntax, LouminAIre-PS aims to be easily understood by users across cultures and educational levels.

Getting Started: [PLACEHOLER - As this is pre-launch at the moment]
placeholder "To get started with LouminAIre-PS, follow the installation instructions and refer to the documentation available in the repository. The documentation provides detailed information on the language syntax, core concepts, and examples to help you write LouminAIre-PS code effectively."

Contributing:
Contributions to LouminAIre-PS are welcome! Whether you want to report a bug, suggest an improvement, or contribute code, please refer to our guidelines for contributing. Together, we can make LouminAIre-PS even better.

Current and Potential LLM Integrations:

BERT: Introduced by Google in 2018, it features 342 million parameters and was pre-trained on a large corpus of data for query understanding in Google search.

Falcon 40B: Developed by the Technology Innovation Institute, it is a transformer-based, causal decoder-only model available in different parameter sizes and is open source.

Galactica: Meta's LLM trained on academic material, generating AI "hallucinations" that were deemed unsafe due to their authoritative tone.

GPT-3.5: An upgraded version of GPT-3 with fewer parameters, powered ChatGPT, and integrated into Bing search.

GPT-4: Released in 2023, GPT-4 is the largest model in OpenAI's GPT series, potentially close to artificial general intelligence (AGI) capabilities.

LaMDA: Google's LLM family pre-trained on a large text corpus, attracting attention for claims of sentience.

Llama(2): Meta AI's LLM available in various parameter sizes, open source, and built on a transformer architecture. (*likely not eligible due to licensing limitations of multi-LLM interoperation clauses)

Orca: Microsoft's LLM with 13 billion parameters, aiming to imitate reasoning procedures achieved by larger models like GPT-4.

PaLM: Google's 540 billion parameter transformer-based model specializing in reasoning tasks and available in fine-tuned versions.

Phi-1: Microsoft's LLM with 1.3 billion parameters, trained on high-quality data for Python coding.

StableLM: An open-source series of LLMs developed by Stability AI, striving to be transparent and supportive.

Claude(2): Anthopic, a spinoff team and LLM from the OpenAI collective.
